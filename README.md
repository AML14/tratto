## Tool name: TRATTO

This is a completely new project which comprises multiple sub-projects, and we are not building anything on top of Toradocu, so it may be a good idea to give the project a new name. A possible name could be _TRATTO – **TRA**nsformer-based **T**oken-by-**T**oken **O**racle generation_ (an Italian word which means “line” or “way”). I think it's important to emphasize the fact that the approach generates oracles token by token, because: 1) it's one the main distinctive features, and 2) this allows the approach to generate variations of the oracles very easily, by replacing a token at any position with the 2nd ranked token and continuing the oracle generation process from there.

## Directory structure

1. `oracle-grammar/` is the folder containing the Xtext project for the grammar of the oracles generated by Jdoctor.
2. `ml-model/` contains all code related to the ML part of this project. This could include many different things, for example, a program for pretraining a transformer on English language and source code (although  we’ll most likely use an already pretrained transformer), a program for fine-tuning the model with the tokens dataset, a program for predicting an output label given an input, etc.
3. `tratto/` contains the main implementation of the project, including: 1) the program for creating the oracles dataset; 2) the program for creating (transforming) the tokens dataset (from the oracles dataset); and 3) the E2E program for generating oracles, generally referred to as TRATTO.
4. `legacy/` contains code and/or resources that should be eventually deleted or integrated into the main projects, i.e., any of the three folders above.

## Conventions

- JDK version: 11.
- Build tool: Maven.
- Conventions related to naming and versioning:
    - `star.tratto` is the parent package (tratto.org is an actual website, so better not to use `org` as the package prefix).
    - `star.tratto` is also the name of the groupId used in Maven.
    - `tratto` is the name of the artifactId used in Maven.
    - The initial version of each artifact is `0.0.1-SNAPSHOT`.
