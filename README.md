TRATTO stands for "**TRA**nsformer-based **T**oken-by-**T**oken **O**racle generation" and is an Italian word that means “line” or “way”. TRATTO generates oracles token by token, in a grammar-directed way, but supported by a neural module to guide the search of oracles toward optimal solutions.

## Directory structure

1. `oracle-grammar/` is the folder containing the Xtext project for the grammar of the oracles generated by Jdoctor.
2. `ml-model/` contains all code related to the ML part of this project. This may include different things, like a program for pretraining a transformer on English language and source code, a program for fine-tuning the model with the tokens dataset, a program for predicting an output label given an input, etc.
3. `tratto/` contains the main implementation of the project, including: 1) the program for creating the oracles dataset; 2) the program for creating (transforming) the tokens dataset (from the oracles dataset); and 3) the E2E program for generating oracles, generally referred to as TRATTO.
4. `legacy/` contains code and/or resources that should be eventually deleted or integrated into the main projects, i.e., any of the three folders above.
