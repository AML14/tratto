   "user":"Given a list of Javadoc tags (starting with @param, @return, or @throws), you need to create up to five semantically-equivalent variants for each of them, by performing the following changes:\r\n1) Replace words with synonyms.\r\n2) Change the order of the sentence.\r\n3) Paraphrase.\r\n4) Shorten.\r\n5) Extend.\r\nHowever, you have to leave the `@param`, `@throws`, and `@return` unchanged.\r\n\r\nIn what follows, I'll provide an example input and the desired output:\r\n\r\ninput = [\r\n    '@return weighted length of shortest path known, or\nDouble.POSITIVE_INFINITY if no path found yet',\r\n    '@throws UnsupportedOperationException if the underlying iterator is not of\ntype {@link ListIterator}'\r\n]\r\n\r\noutput = [\r\n  {\r\n    'tag': '@return weighted length of shortest path known, or\nDouble.POSITIVE_INFINITY if no path found yet',\r\n    'alternatives': [\r\n      '@return weighted distance of the most short route known,\notherwiseDouble.POSITIVE_INFINITY if no route discovered until now',\r\n      '@return Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY if no path found yet, or\nweighted length of shortest path known.',\r\n      '@return either return the weighted length of the shortest path known,\nor return Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY if no path was found yet',\r\n      '@return weighted length shortest path known or\nDouble.POSITIVE_INFINITY if no path found',\r\n      '@return the weighted length of the shortest path that is known. Otherwise\nreturn Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY if no path has been found yet.'\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    'tag': '@throws UnsupportedOperationException if the underlying iterator is not of\ntype {@link ListIterator}',\r\n    'alternatives': [\r\n      '@throws UnsupportedOperationException if the iterator underlying the operation\nis not of type {@link ListIterator}.',\r\n      '@throws UnsupportedOperationException if the underlying iterator does not\nbelong to the {@link ListIterator} type.',\r\n      '@throws UnsupportedOperationException when the underlying iterator is not\nan instance of {@link ListIterator}.',\r\n      '@throws UnsupportedOperationException if the type of the underlying iterator\ndiffers from {@link ListIterator}.',\r\n      '@throws UnsupportedOperationException if the iterator underlying the operation\nis not a {@link ListIterator}.'\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe output must be a list of objects containing two attributes: the attribute `tag` contains the string representing the original javadoc tag, while the attribute `alternatives` contains the list of the five different alternatives that you produce from the original javadoc tag.\r\n\r\nIn the next messages I will provide the input to process.\r\n\r\nPlease, format the output in the way I showed before. Remember also that if the original javadoc tags starts with '@param' also all the corresponding alternatives must start with '@param', and the same holds for '@return' and '@throws'. Only return the list, without any other comment or word.\r\nDid you understand the task?",
   "assistant": "Yes, I understood the task. You want me to take a list of Javadoc tags starting with `@param,` `@return,` or `@throws` and generate up to five semantically-equivalent variants for each tag. The variants should be created by replacing words with synonyms, changing the sentence order, paraphrasing, shortening, or extending the original tag. The output should follow a specific format with the original tag and its alternatives. I will generate the alternatives accordingly. Please provide the input for me to process."
