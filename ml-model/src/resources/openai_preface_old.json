   "user":"Given a list of Javadoc tags (starting with @param, @return, or @throws), you need to create up to five semantically-equivalent variants for each of them, by performing the following changes:\r\n1) Replace words with synonyms.\r\n2) Change the order of the sentence.\r\n3) Paraphrase.\r\n4) Shorten.\r\n5) Extend.\r\nHowever, you have to leave the `@param`, `@throws`, and `@return` unchanged.\r\n\r\nIn what follows, I\\'ll provide an example input and the desired output:\r\n\r\ninput = [\r\n    \"@return weighted length of shortest path known, or\\nDouble.POSITIVE_INFINITY if no path found yet\",\r\n    \"\"@throws UnsupportedOperationException if the underlying iterator is not of\\ntype {@link ListIterator}\"\r\n]\r\n\r\noutput = [{\r\n    \"alternative1\": \"@return weighted distance of the most short route known,\\notherwiseDouble.POSITIVE_INFINITY if no route discovered until now\",\r\n    \"alternative2\": \"@return Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY if no path found yet, or\\nweighted length of shortest path known.\",\r\n    \"alternative3\": \"@return either return the weighted length of the shortest path known,\\nor return Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY if no path was found yet\",\r\n    \"alternative4\":  \"@return weighted length shortest path known or\\nDouble.POSITIVE_INFINITY if no path found\",\r\n    \"alternative5\": \"@return the weighted length of the shortest path that is known. Otherwise\\nreturn Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY if no path has been found yet.\"\r\n}, {\r\n\"alternative1\": \"@throws UnsupportedOperationException if the iterator underlying the operation\\nis not of type {@link ListIterator}.\",\r\n\"alternative2\": \"@throws UnsupportedOperationException if the underlying iterator does not\\nbelong to the {@link ListIterator} type.\",\r\n\"alternative3\": \"@throws UnsupportedOperationException when the underlying iterator is not\\nan instance of {@link ListIterator}.\",\r\n\"alternative4\": \"@throws UnsupportedOperationException if the type of the underlying iterator\\ndiffers from {@link ListIterator}.\",\r\n\"alternative5\": \"@throws UnsupportedOperationException if the iterator underlying the operation\\nis not a {@link ListIterator}.\"\r\n}]\r\n\r\nFor what concern the punctuation, you have to consider different variants: for example, you can generate a complete javadoc tag that can end or not with `.`, and you can use `,`, `:`, `.`, `;` punctuation characters within the middle of the javadoc tag to divide sentences, or consider to not use punctuation at all.\r\n\r\nFor example: \"@return either return the weighted length of the shortest path known,\\nor return Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY if no path was found yet\" does not contain any punctuation, while the other alternative \"@return the weighted length of the shortest path that is known. Otherwise\\nreturn Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY if no path has been found yet.\" contains two dots in the middle and at the end of the sentence (Notice that the `.` that refers to code fragments, like `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY` must be leave unchanged).\r\n\r\nPlease, consider also the following possible patterns to make some changes. The patterns are provided as a list of lists, like this: [[ pattern_1, pattern_2, pattern_3 ], [ pattern_4, pattern_5, pattern_6 ]], where each element in each list is an equivalent way to express the same concept within the same list, therefore whenever you find the `pattern_2` in the original javadoc, for example, you can generate a new javadoc where `pattern_2` is substituted with `pattern_1` or `pattern_3` for example. You are not obliged to apply the pattern changes any time, but please do it as much as possible.\r\n\r\nThese are the patterns you can apply:\r\n\r\npatterns = [\r\n\t[\"must be\", \"have to be\", \"shall be\", \"need to be\", \"is required to be\", \"should be\", \"can be\"],\r\n\t[\"if any of\", \"if one of\", \"if at least one of\"],\r\n\t[\"if\", \"whenever\", \"anytime\", \"when\"],\r\n\t[\"to be\", \"that must be used\", \"that have to be\", \"that shall be\", \"that needs to be\", \"that is required to be\", \"that should be\"],\r\n\t[\"of\", \"of the\"],\r\n\t[\"cannot be\", \"must not be\", \"should not be\", \"not have to be\"],\r\n\t[\"for the\", \"given the\", \"with the\"],\r\n\t[\"otherwise\", \"in the other case\", \"differently\", \"any other time\", \"under the other conditions\"],\r\n\t[\"are inconsistent\", \"are not consistent\"],\r\n\t[\"too\", \"very\", \"extremely\", \"excessively\", \"highly\"],\r\n\t[\"may be\", \"can be\", \"could be\", \"can happen to be\"],\r\n\t[\"on the\", \"about the\"],\r\n\t[\"does not match\", \"is not equal to\", \"is different to\", \"differ from\"],\r\n\t[\"at least one\", \"more than zero\", \"one or more\"],\r\n\t[\"to compare with\", \"to analyze\", \"to distinguish\"],\r\n\t[\"equal\", \"not different\", \"identical\", \"equivalent\"],\r\n\t[\"this\", \"that\"],\r\n\t[\"nonnegative\", \"non-negative\", \"not negative\", \"zero or positive\", \"greater than -1\"],\r\n\t[\"allowed\", \"permitted\", \"acceptable\", \"accepted\", \"admissible\"],\r\n\t[\"positive\", \"greater than zero\", \"greater than 0\", \"bigger than zero\", \"bigger than 0\"],\r\n\t[\"zero-length\", \"length equals to 0\", \"zero length\", \"length equals to zero\", \"less than 1\"],\r\n\t[\"less than 0\", \"less than zero\", \"negative\", \"smaller than zero\", \"smaller than 0\"]\r\n]\r\n\r\nFor example, an alternative way to produce the javadoc tag \"@throws NotPositiveException if any of the probabilities are negative.\" could be \"@throws NotPositiveException whenever any of the probabilities are less than zero.\", where \"if\" has been replaced with \"whenever\", given the list of equivalent choices [\"if\", \"whenever\", \"anytime\", \"when\"], and the \"negative\" word has been replaced with \"less than zero\", given the list of equivalent choices [\"less than 0\", \"less than zero\", \"negative\", \"smaller than zero\", \"smaller than 0\"].\r\n\r\nThe following is the list of the original javadoc tags that I kindly ask you to process. Please, give me the output as a list of objects containing the alternative ways to write the corresponding original javadoc tags. Format the output in the way I showed before, and consider the pattern changes and the different way to produce the punctuations when you generate the alternatives (however the punctuation of parts of the javadoc tags that refer to code like 'singletons.length' must be unchanged). Remember also that if the original javadoc tags starts with '@param' also all the corresponding alternatives must start with '@param', if the original javadoc tags starts with '@return' also all the corresponding alternatives must start with '@return', and if the original javadoc tags starts with '@throws' also all the corresponding alternatives must start with '@throws'. Only return the list, without any other comment or word.\r\n\r\n"
