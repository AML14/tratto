= New & Noteworthy

[[new-features.6-3-0]]
== What's new in Lettuce 6.3

* <<_redis_functions,Redis Function support>> (`fcall` and `FUNCTION` commands).
* Support for Library Name and Version through `LettuceVersion`.
Automated registration of the Lettuce library version upon connection handshake.
* Support for Micrometer Tracing to trace observations (distributed tracing and metrics).

[[new-features.6-2-0]]
== What's new in Lettuce 6.2

* <<redisuri.authentication,`RedisCredentialsProvider`>> abstraction to externalize credentials and credentials rotation.
* Retrieval of Redis Cluster node connections using `ConnectionIntent` to obtain read-only connections.
* Master/Replica now uses `SENTINEL REPLICAS` to discover replicas instead of `SENTINEL SLAVES`.

[[new-features.6-1-0]]
== What's new in Lettuce 6.1

* Kotlin Coroutines support for `SCAN`/`HSCAN`/`SSCAN`/`ZSCAN` through `ScanFlow`.
* Command Listener API through `RedisClient.addListener(CommandListener)`.
* <<command.latency.metrics.micrometer,Micrometer support>> through `MicrometerCommandLatencyRecorder`.
* <<native.transport,Experimental support for `io_uring`>>.
* Configuration of extended Keep-Alive options through `KeepAliveOptions` (only available for some transports/Java versions).
* Configuration of netty's `AddressResolverGroup` through `ClientResources`.
Uses `DnsAddressResolverGroup` when `netty-resolver-dns` is on the classpath.
* Add support for Redis ACL commands.
* <<events.flight-recorder,Java Flight Recorder Events>>

[[new-features.6-0-0]]
== What's new in Lettuce 6.0

* Support for RESP3 usage with Redis 6 along with RESP2/RESP3 handshake and protocol version discovery.
* ACL authentication using username and password or password-only authentication.
* Cluster topology refresh is now non-blocking.
* <<kotlin,Kotlin Coroutine Extensions>>.
* RxJava 3 support.
* Refined Scripting API accepting the Lua script either as `byte[]` or `String`.
* Connection and Queue failures now no longer throw an exception but properly associate the failure with the Future handle.
* Removal of deprecated API including timeout methods accepting `TimeUnit`.
Use methods accepting `Duration` instead.
* Lots of internal refinements.
* `xpending` methods return now `List<PendingMessage>` and `PendingMessages`
* Spring support removed.
Use Spring Data Redis for a seamless Spring integration with Lettuce.
* `AsyncConnectionPoolSupport.createBoundedObjectPool(…)` methods are now blocking to await pool initialization.
* `DecodeBufferPolicy` for fine-grained memory reclaim control.
* `RedisURI.toString()` renders masked password.
* `ClientResources.commandLatencyCollector(…)` refactored into `ClientResources.commandLatencyRecorder(…)` returning `CommandLatencyRecorder`.

[[new-features.5-3-0]]
== What's new in Lettuce 5.3

* Improved SSL configuration supporting Cipher suite selection and PEM-encoded certificates.
* Fixed method signature for `randomkey()`.
* Un-deprecated `ClientOptions.pingBeforeActivateConnection` to allow connection verification during connection handshake.

[[new-features.5-2-0]]
== What's new in Lettuce 5.2

* Allow randomization of read candidates using Redis Cluster.
* SSL support for Redis Sentinel.

[[new-features.5-1-0]]
== What's new in Lettuce 5.1

* Add support for `ZPOPMIN`, `ZPOPMAX`, `BZPOPMIN`, `BZPOPMAX` commands.
* Add support for Redis Command Tracing through Brave, see <<client-resources>>.
* Add support for https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro[Redis Streams].
* Asynchronous `connect()` for Master/Replica connections.
* <<connection-pooling.asynchronous.usage>> through `AsyncConnectionPoolSupport` and `AsyncPool`.
* Dedicated exceptions for Redis `LOADING`, `BUSY`, and `NOSCRIPT` responses.
* Commands in at-most-once mode (auto-reconnect disabled) are now canceled already on disconnect.
* Global command timeouts (also for reactive and asynchronous API usage) configurable through <<client-options>>.
* Host and port mappers for Lettuce usage behind connection tunnels/proxies through `SocketAddressResolver`, see <<client-resources>>.
* `SCRIPT LOAD` dispatch to all cluster nodes when issued through `RedisAdvancedClusterCommands`.
* Reactive `ScanStream` to iterate over the keyspace using `SCAN` commands.
* Transactions using Master/Replica connections are bound to the master node.

[[new-features.5-0-0]]
== What's new in Lettuce 5.0

* New artifact coordinates: `io.lettuce:lettuce-core` and packages moved from `com.lambdaworks.redis` to `io.lettuce.core`.
* <<reactive-api,Reactive API>> now Reactive Streams-based using https://projectreactor.io/[Project Reactor].
* <<redis-command-interfaces,Redis Command Interfaces>> supporting dynamic command invocation and Redis Modules.
* Enhanced, immutable Key-Value objects.
* Asynchronous Cluster connect.
* Native transport support for Kqueue on macOS systems.
* Removal of support for Guava.
* Removal of deprecated `RedisConnection` and `RedisAsyncConnection` interfaces.
* Java 9 compatibility.
* HTML and PDF reference documentation along with a new project website: https://lettuce.io.
