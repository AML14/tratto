/**
 * This annotation marks the Lettuce Coroutine API that is considered experimental and is not subject to the
 * general compatibility guarantees given for the library.
 * The behavior and design of such API may be changed in any further release.
 *
 * Beware using the annotated API especially if you're developing a library, since your library might become binary incompatible
 * with the future versions of the standard library.
 *
 * Any usage of a declaration annotated with `@ExperimentalLettuceCoroutinesApi` must be accepted either by
 * annotating that usage with the [OptIn] annotation, e.g. `@OptIn(ExperimentalLettuceCoroutinesApi::class)`,
 * or by using the compiler argument `-Xopt-in=io.lettuce.core.ExperimentalLettuceCoroutinesApi`.
