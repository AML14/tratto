package algorithm:
	
	[gsavin,27/02/2009]
	? Clarify the Algorithm structure
		- delete setGraph( Graph )
		+ add an init method : init( Graph graph, Object ... params )
		- in algorithm's implementations : just an empty constructor
		
		Opinion ?

package graph :
	
	? Clarify the Graph.setAutoCreate() et Graph.setStrictChecking() ... not very clear.
	
		Comments :
		
	? Remove the Graph.getNodeSet() etc. ? See the following idea.
	
		Comments :
	
	? Allow Node, Edge, Graph to be Iterable (usable in the foreach statement), for example
		for( Node node: graph ) {
			System.out.printf( "%s%n", node.getId();
			for( Edge edge: node ) {
				System.out.printf( "    %s%n", edge.getId() );
			}
		}
		
	  Maybe allow some methods like Graph.getNodeSet() to return an Iterable object without
	  necessarily having such a set in the graph implementation (an iterator would suffice). We
	  could change the Graph.getNodeSet() name for this. The goal of these methods is to allow
	  to easily browse the graph using foreach.
