 * This enum represents all possible types of oracles that can be generated by

 * normal post-condition ({@code NORMAL_POST}), or an exceptional
 * post-condition ({@code EXCEPT_POST}). Otherwise, if an oracle is
 * non-axiomatic, then it is labeled as {@code NON_AXIOMATIC}, which is not
 * strictly defined as a pre, post, or exceptional condition.
